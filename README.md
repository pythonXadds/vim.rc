# __PythonXadds .Vimrc__


  This is my **.vimrc,** it uses Vundle.vim as a plugin manager

The plugins includud within this Vimrc are:

* Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim' (Plugin manager)
* Plugin 'JamshedVesuna/vim-markdown-preview'
* Plugin 'dracula/vim' (Theme)
* Plugin 'kannokanno/previm'
* Plugin 'wincent/ferret'
* Plugin 'kamykn/spelunker.vim'
* Plugin 'othree/xml.vim'

VundleVim can be got here: `https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim`

Set up Vundle:

<git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim>

**Install Plugins:**

Launch vim and run :PluginInstall


To get the two themes working, create a *.vim* folder and a Folder called: *colors* then copy any themes you want into the folder.



Note: I also install **cream** which makes gvim very much easier, and to be honest, sometimes one wants to use a mouse!

You can install it on Debian/Ubuntu by typing into a terminal [sudo apt install cream] 

its website is: http://cream.sourceforge.net/home.html

thought it's not updated much these days. i'd love to fork it and perhaps re-awaken this project.
